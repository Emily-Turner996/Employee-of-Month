# Employee-of-Month
<em> Program developed by Emily Turner </em>

## About this Program:
This is just a little project I'm working on for fun. An overcomplicated solution to a small problem encountered at work regarding voting for an employee of the month. Employees would look at what others wrote when we voted by hand. This program aims to make that more difficult, and to prevent employees from voting multiple times. <br>
As suggested previously, this program is not complete yet. It functions, but there's many other additions I want to add to it to make it more user friendly and so it isn't too easy to cheat the system. <br>
The program allows the user to vote by entering the pin they use to clock in and the name of the person they're voting for.

## Links
I'm sure many people in the CS field know how infuriating errors can be, and how common it is to seek help from the internet. Here I'm compiling a list of links that were used to give me more direct code that I likely wouldn't have come up with on my own. Just a little way to avoid credit for things that aren't really mine.
